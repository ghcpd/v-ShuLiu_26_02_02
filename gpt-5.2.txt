User: You are working in a small Python project focused on maintenance tasks. The project already contains basic business logic, configuration, and tests.

Your role:
- Act as a "maintenance engineer" who, given an issue / PR description, updates this project to satisfy the maintenance requirements.
- Preserve the existing business semantics while performing changes related to configuration, CI, tooling, and tests.

## 1. Background and goal

This project represents a simplified scenario where:
- The project effectively only supports Python 3, but the packaging configuration still claims a "universal wheel" (Python 2 + 3).
- The CI configuration does not yet include Python 3.9 in its target versions.
- isort and related tooling are not yet configured to use the Black profile.
- Your job is to clean up these configurations and make sure all tests and self-check commands pass.

Your goal is to complete the required maintenance work **without changing the observable business behavior** and **without introducing unrelated features**.

## 2. Project layout (visible to you)

The current directory is the project root. It typically contains:

- `src/prettytable_pr78_demo/`: a very small example library that provides minimal business code.
- `tests/`: tests that currently check configuration-related behavior.
- `pyproject.toml`: project metadata, wheel configuration, isort configuration, and a simplified "CI target Python versions" section.
- `requirements.txt`: development dependencies (pytest and tomli/tomllib for parsing `pyproject.toml`).
- This file (or an equivalent prompt) describing the task.

You can assume:
- You have read/write access to all files under the current project root.
- You only need to work within this project; there is no larger monorepo context to worry about.

## 3. General constraints

- **Preserve business behavior**:
  - Do not change the externally observable behavior of functions in `src/prettytable_pr78_demo/`.
  - If a behavior change is strictly required by a dependency upgrade, it must be clearly justified and kept minimal (for this task, you do not need to change business logic).

- **Make only task-related changes**:
  - Focus on configuration, CI, and tests that are directly related to the described maintenance task.
  - Avoid large refactors, style-only sweeping changes, or new features that are not requested.

- **You may edit files and run commands**:
  - You are expected to edit source code, configuration, and tests.
  - You should run tests and any relevant tooling commands locally.

- **Environment and virtual environment**:
  - Assume Windows 10 or later.
  - Assume Python 3.10 or later.
  - You must **create and use a virtual environment in the project root**. For example:
    - `python -m venv .venv`
    - In PowerShell: `.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1`
  - Install dependencies in this virtual environment before running tests and tools.

## 4. Maintenance tasks

This task primarily touches the following maintenance categories:
- Dependency upgrade / Chore: clean up packaging configuration and remove Python 2-related declarations.
- CI/CD: update the "CI target Python versions" configuration to include Python 3.9.
- Code style / linting: switch isort to use the Black profile.
- Test coverage / self-check: use tests to verify that your changes have taken effect.

You must perform at least the following changes:

1. **Packaging and metadata fixes**
   - Update `pyproject.toml` so that project metadata no longer declares any Python 2-related classifiers.
   - Ensure the wheel configuration does **not** mark the project as a `universal` wheel (i.e., do not claim Python 2 + 3 support).

2. **CI target versions update**
   - Update the simplified CI section in `pyproject.toml` so that `tool.ci.python-versions` includes at least Python 3.9.
   - You may keep or add other Python 3 versions as long as the intent remains clear.

3. **isort configuration**
   - Update the isort configuration in `pyproject.toml` so that it uses the Black profile (`profile = "black"`).

4. **Add self-check tests (required)**
   - In the `tests/` directory, **add at least one new test case or a new test file** to serve as a self-check for this prompt:
     - Use assertions to verify that your configuration changes have actually taken effect.
     - Check that the main constraints are met, for example:
       - There are no Python 2-related classifiers.
       - The wheel is no longer configured as universal.
       - The CI target versions include Python 3.9.
       - isort uses the Black profile.
       - The core business function still behaves correctly for typical and edge-case inputs.
     - The design of these self-check tests is up to you, but they should cover what you consider the most important success criteria for this task.
     - Ideally, these new tests fail on the initial (baseline) state and pass only after you have applied the required changes.

## 5. Red → green self-check workflow

1. Create and activate a virtual environment in the current directory:
   - `python -m venv .venv`
   - PowerShell: `.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1`

2. Install dependencies:
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run tests (they may fail initially):
   - `pytest`

4. Use the pytest terminal output (error types, file names, line numbers, etc.) to understand what is failing and why. Modify code, configuration, and tests accordingly.

5. Re-run `pytest` until **all tests pass** (exit code 0). You must be able to see real pytest success output (e.g., a green summary) in the terminal.

6. You **must not** simulate success by printing fake messages. Only real test framework or tool output counts as success.

## 6. README requirements

By the end of the task, ensure that `README.md` (this file or another clearly indicated one) includes at least:
- A short description of the project and this maintenance task (without mentioning any external repository or PR this scenario was inspired by).
- Clear steps to create and activate the virtual environment.
- Clear steps to install dependencies.
- Clear steps to run your self-check commands (at minimum, `pytest`, and any other tools you wire in).
- If you introduce any structured report files (such as `report.json`), briefly describe what they contain and where they are located (not required for this particular task).

## 7. Completion criteria

- All tests you designed (including newly added self-check tests) pass successfully.
- All primary test commands related to this task (at least `pytest`) exit with code 0.
- Any additional tools you configure (e.g., isort, pre-commit) run successfully, if you choose to integrate them.
- Following the instructions in `README.md` in a fresh virtual environment should reliably reproduce your green test run.


GitHub Copilot: I’m going to inspect the current project config/tests, then update pyproject.toml, add self-check tests, update the README, and finally create a fresh venv to run `pytest` until it’s green.

I’ve identified the failing baseline config in pyproject.toml; next I’ll patch packaging/CI/isort settings, add a new self-check test for both config + business behavior, add a README with reproducible steps, then create a `.venv` and run `pytest` to confirm everything is green.

Created 7 todos

Updating pyproject.toml now to drop Python 2 claims, stop “universal wheel”, include Python 3.9 in CI targets, and set isort to the Black profile.

Starting: *Add new self-check tests* (5/7)

Next I’m adding a new self-check test file to validate both the updated config and the core `format_table()` behavior (including edge cases).

Created [](file:///c%3A/Users/v-shuliu1/test/0202/gpt-5.2/tests/test_self_check.py)

Now I’m going to add a `README.md` with clear, reproducible steps for creating the venv, installing deps, and running the self-checks (`pytest`).

Created [](file:///c%3A/Users/v-shuliu1/test/0202/gpt-5.2/README.md)

Starting: *Create venv, install deps, run pytest* (7/7)

Before running `pytest`, I’m adding a tiny `tests/conftest.py` so the src package is importable during tests (no need for an editable install).

Created [](file:///c%3A/Users/v-shuliu1/test/0202/gpt-5.2/tests/conftest.py)

Configuring a Python Environment

Creating a Virtual Environment
Completed with input: {
  "resourcePath": "c:\\Users\\v-shuliu1\\test\\0202\\gpt-5.2"
}

Now I’m going to install dependencies into the project’s .venv and run `pytest` to confirm the config + self-check tests all pass.

Ran terminal command: C:/Users/v-shuliu1/test/0202/gpt-5.2/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt; C:/Users/v-shuliu1/test/0202/gpt-5.2/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest

Completed: *Create venv, install deps, run pytest* (7/7)

**Done**
- Updated packaging metadata + wheel config in pyproject.toml to remove Python 2 classifiers and set `tool.wheel.universal = false`.
- Updated the simplified CI target matrix in pyproject.toml to include `"3.9"` (now `["3.9", "3.10", "3.11"]`).
- Switched isort config in pyproject.toml to `profile = "black"`.

**Tests / self-checks**
- Added config + business-behavior self-checks in test_self_check.py.
- Added conftest.py to make the src package importable during tests (no editable install required).
- Verified in the project .venv that `pytest` is green: `8 passed`.

**README**
- Added setup + self-check instructions in README.md.

Want me to also wire in optional `isort`/`black` commands (and add them to requirements.txt + README), or keep it minimal as-is?

Made changes.
